There are two main folders, `server and client`.
- The client is the `ui/frontend` for the application
- The server is the `backend` where an `api` is created to make communication between the client side and the server side possible.

>make sure you installed node on your machine first


To run the client/frontend 
```bash
❯ cd client

❯ npm install

❯ npm start
```
The frontend will start at localhost at port 3000 but won't show any data because we didn't start the backend server and it's not finished yet.

To run the server/backend
```bash
❯ cd server

❯ npm install

❯ npm run dev
```
The backend will start at localhost at port 5000.
